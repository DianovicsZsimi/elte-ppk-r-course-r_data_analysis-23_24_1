# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
library(readr)
library(rlang)
library(dplyr)

urlfile = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv"

cocktaildata <- read_tsv(url(urlfile))
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
#This is for putting ingredients into different columns

cocktaildata_try <- cocktaildata |> 
  separate(ingredients,
           into = c("ingredient1", "ingredient2", "ingredient3", "ingredient4", "ingredient5", "ingredient6"),
           sep = c("<br/>|<br>|<b4/>")
  )

```

```{r}
#This is for deleting the unnecessary clutter

clean_function <- function(dataframe, column_name, pattern_to_replace, replacement_string) {
  for (column_name in column_name) {
  dataframe[[column_name]] <- gsub(pattern_to_replace, replacement_string, dataframe[[column_name]])
  dataframe[[column_name]] <- trimws(dataframe[[column_name]])
  }
  return(dataframe)
}

pattern_to_replace <- "^\\d+\\s*\\d*/\\d*\\s*oz\\s*|\\b\\d+[/.]?\\d*\\s*oz\\b|\\b\\d+[/.]?\\d*\\s*abv\\b|\\(.*?\\)|\\d+ drops\\s+|\\d+ dash\\s+|\\d+ dashes\\s+|\\d+ drop\\s+|\\d+ bsp\\s+"
replacement_string <- ""
columns_to_update <- c("ingredient1", "ingredient2", "ingredient3", "ingredient4", "ingredient5", "ingredient6")
cocktaildata_complete <- clean_function(cocktaildata_try, columns_to_update, pattern_to_replace, replacement_string)

#How can I do this more elegantly, so I do not have to find each measurment and delete it sort of manually with a regex
```


## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}

cocktaildata_complete |> 
  count(ingredient1)

n_distinct(cocktaildata_complete$ingredient2)

cocktaildata_complete |> 
  unique_ingredients2 <- unique(c(ingredient1, ingredient2, ingredient3, ingredient4, ingredient5, ingredient6))
  
  
unique_ingredients <- unique(c(cocktaildata_complete$ingredient1, cocktaildata_complete$ingredient2, cocktaildata_complete$ingredient3, cocktaildata_complete$ingredient4, cocktaildata_complete$ingredient5, cocktaildata_complete$ingredient6))

sorted_ingredients <- sort(unique_ingredients) 
  print(sorted_ingredients)
  

```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}

```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}

```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}

```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}

```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}

```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}

```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
